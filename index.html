          <p>Star Wars episode one made in 1977 was the first ever made, here is a little summary.
            Obi-Wan Kenobi  is a young apprentice Jedi knight under the tutelage of Qui-Gon Jinn  ; Anakin Skywalker , who will later father Luke Skywalker and become known as Darth Vader, is just a 9-year-old boy. When the Trade Federation cuts off all routes to the planet Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to settle the matter.</p>
            <p>Episode 2: Set ten years after the events of "The Phantom Menace," the Republic continues to be mired in strife and chaos. A separatist movement encompassing hundreds of planets and powerful corporate alliances poses new threats to the galaxy that even the Jedi cannot stem. These moves, long planned by an as yet unrevealed and powerful force, lead to the beginning of the Clone Wars -- and the beginning of the end of the Republic.</p>
            <p>Episode 3: It has been three years since the Clone Wars began. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi  and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker  rescue Chancellor Palpatine  from General Grievous, the commander of the droid armies, but Grievous escapes. Suspicions are raised within the Jedi Council concerning Chancellor Palpatine, with whom Anakin has formed a bond. Asked to spy on the chancellor, and full of bitterness toward the Jedi Council, Anakin embraces the Dark Side.</p>
            <p>Episode 4: The Imperial Forces -- under orders from cruel Darth Vader  -- hold Princess Leia  hostage, in their efforts to quell the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Luke Skywalker  and Han Solo , captain of the Millennium Falcon, work together with the companionable droid duo R2-D2 and C-3PO  to rescue the beautiful princess, help the Rebel Alliance, and restore freedom and justice to the Galaxy. </p>
            <p>Episode 5: The adventure continues in this "Star Wars" sequel. Luke Skywalker , Han Solo , Princess Leia  and Chewbacca  face attack by the Imperial forces and its AT-AT walkers on the ice planet Hoth.
